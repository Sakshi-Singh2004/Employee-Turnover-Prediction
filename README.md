# Employee-Turnover-Prediction
Employee turnover is defined as the number of employees who quit the organization or are asked to leave and are replaced by new employees.
Employee turnover is usually calculated on a yearly basis. It doesn’t matter whether the employees resigned or were fired.
This phenomenon may have a certain undesirable impact but isn’t necessarily all that bad because if a number of employees leave, there are new ones joining in. 
With employee turnover, one can understand an organization, its workplace culture, compensation, policies, and people procedures. It is a window into knowing the organization’s employee experience, their average tenure with the organization, etc.
Staff turnover gives you insights and data to understand your hiring practices and fill in necessary gaps. It also helps in arresting costs that organizations would spend on:
Recruitment, Onboarding, Training, Benefits, Replacement hires
